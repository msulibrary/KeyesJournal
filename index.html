<h1 style= "font-family: helvetica; text-align: center;">Tales from Yellowstone Park</h1>
<div>	<section>
    <div id="one"><p style= "font-family: helvetica;">Since its establishment in 1872, Yellowstone park has had over 150 million visitors. Each one of these visitors had their own 
		unique experience, some leaving with treasured memories and maybe some pictures. While it may just be a quick car ride away nowadays, travelling the
		park before automobiles became a common part of American life was a very different experience. The Special Collections at MSU has a handful of
		journals and photos from these early tourists, documenting their travels. Some of the more thorough accounts have been selected to be featured in
		this map, documenting their travels in the park. Some of the accounts featured here include the journal of Henry F. Keyes, a young Harvard student
		who traveled through in 1899, hiking much of the park, until an injury cut his visit short, or Charles Hoff, who rode through in a wagon with his 
		brother and family in September of 1908. All of these accounts remark on the natural beauty of the park and its unique thermal features.
